# mentorship-team

## I would like to be part of the Node.js mentorship team because it would be an opportunity to contribute to the project directly and to open source in general. Speaking of the benefit to me, I would like to improve as a Node.js developer- qualitatively with respect to code review; and quantitatively with respect to developer productivity.
